# ðŸš€ About Completing SQL Bootcamp

I have successfully completed the **SQL Bootcamp**, where I learned the fundamentals and advanced concepts of working with SQL. During the training, I mastered the following topics:

- **SQL Basics**: Learned fundamental SQL commands such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` for working with data.
- **Advanced SQL**: Gained expertise in advanced concepts, including joins, subqueries, window functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
- **Data Analysis**: Applied SQL to real-world scenarios, solving tasks related to data analysis.
- **Database Management**: Learned the fundamentals of database design, normalization, and optimization for efficient management.
- **Project Examples**: Applied my knowledge to practical tasks and projects, such as analyzing data in e-commerce and social media domains.

This program helped me deepen my SQL knowledge and taught me how to apply it to solve real-world data analysis and database management tasks.
